# Mindmap
The essense of this project is to build a clone of the animations found in the Android app - **tinycards from duolingo**. 
Am only trying to replicate one screen for the walk-through, but in that screen there are a couple of animations namely:
+ a rotateY transform when you click a card - that is the part that i currently have in the application
+ a spring animation (i think) that moves a card with fixed height and width from the bottom of the screen to a certain 
location and then transforms (using translateX i suppose) the card off the screen.

### My questions are as follows:
1) The screen i have currently has a TapGesture handler to flip the card but the animation is not exactly correct and am not sure what am doing wrongly. The Component to check is Card.js
2) How do i get started with the second animation, please kindly direct me with some resource or general description of a fix.
