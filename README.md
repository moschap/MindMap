## Update
Thank you once again for the last update that you submitted, so this is what i was planning on designing, checkout this [**Tinycards** game animation that i recorded on my phone](https://app.box.com/s/vq233dfcwoqcw2b07tj7bkeeb91wi23j).You will notice that when the animation starts the card comes UP from the bottom of the screen then stops at a certain point before it slides off the screen on the X axis. That is what i want to do for this next phase.

My questions is
1. Please can you rather than write the code, describe to me how to solve the problem, i want to see if i can write the code instead. I have actually done something but it doesnt work you can check it out @ [QuestionsCard.js](https://github.com/moschap/MindMap/blob/master/src/QuestionCards.js)

## End of Update

The essense of this project is to build a clone of the animations found in the Android app - **tinycards from duolingo**. 
Am only trying to replicate one screen for the walk-through, but in that screen there are a couple of animations namely:
+ a rotateY transform when you click a card - that is the part that i currently have in the application
+ a spring animation (i think) that moves a card with fixed height and width from the bottom of the screen to a certain 
location and then transforms (using translateX i suppose) the card off the screen.

### My questions are as follows:
1) The screen i have currently has a TapGesture handler to flip the card but the animation is not exactly correct and am not sure what am doing wrongly. The Component to check is Card.js
2) How do i get started with the second animation, please kindly direct me with some resource or general description of a fix.
